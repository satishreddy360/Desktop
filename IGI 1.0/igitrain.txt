Project IGI +2 Trainer version 1.2

After an insane amount of mail ive finally gotten my act together and updated the trainer.
Heres whats new since version 1.1 :

- The godmode now makes you immune to electric fences
- The M16 wont run out of grenades
- I added hotkeys to the cheats because some machines crash when you shell out of IGI
  Press F11 for unlimited ammo and F12 for godmode.
- Version checking is removed because it didnt work under some circumstances. Please keep
  in mind that trying to use this trainer on any other version of IGI than 1.0 it may crash the game

I was not able to make you cowards immune to those annoying APC's but hey, when you are able to
fall 50ft, being shot a few hundred times, hit severly in the face and stand next to an exploding
computer without getting as much as a scratch you must surely be able to outrun a mere tank :)

This is the LAST version of the trainer. There will be NO more updates whatsoever. If the trainer
does not work for you then i am truly sorry but i simply dont have the time to help you out.

I do NOT do requests, not even if your mothers life depends on it. Remember that if you search the
right way, the net can provide you with anything.

An extremely merry christmas to y'all!
