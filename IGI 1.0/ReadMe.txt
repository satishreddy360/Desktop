Instructions:

1. Unzip files.
2. Copy / paste config.qvm to your PC directory where you installed Project IGI
        - By default this is C:\Program Files\Eidos Interactive\Project IGI\pc
        - You must also overwrite the previous file.
3. Play the game! The controls may seem weird since I was using a joystick... just reconfigure them.


Note: If this all went over your head, just run install.bat and it will do it for you.


                           Have fun!

P.S. You'd better have fun! Took me a long time to finish this one!
